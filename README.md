### Disclaimer

The following example is a simple script showing how to utilize Smartproxy with Cheerio.js.
We suggest to reseach [Cheerio.js](https://cheerio.js.org/) documentation in order to continue development with this tool.

### Prerequisites

To run our example script, you are going to need a few libraries as well as Node.js.

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [Cheerio.js](https://cheerio.js.org/)
* [Requests](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request)

### Installation

1. Once you have your project directory ready for development with Cheerio.js, open it using Terminal/Command prompt utilising `cd` command.
2. After that, execute the following command to download our proxy setup example file:

`curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Smartproxy/Smartproxy/master/cheerio/cheerio.js > cheerio.js`
