### Disclaimer

The following example is a simple script that shows how to use Decodo with Cheerio.js.
We suggest researching [Cheerio.js](https://cheerio.js.org/) documentation in order to continue development with this tool.

### Prerequisites

To run our example script, you are going to need a few libraries as well as Node.js.

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [Cheerio.js](https://cheerio.js.org/)
* [Axios](https://axios-http.com)

### Installation

1. Once you have your project directory ready for development with Cheerio.js, open it using Terminal/Command prompt utilizing `cd` command.
2. After that, execute the following command to download our proxy setup example file:

`curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Decodo/Cheerio/master/cheerio.js > cheerio.js`

3. You should see a new file named cheerio.js in your project folder. Edit it using an editor of your choice.

4. To set up your username, password, and endpoint you would like to use, change the corresponding lines within punctuation marks ('').
